## General Information
-  Background: A bike-sharing system is a service in which bikes are made available for shared use to individuals on a short term basis for a price or free. Many bike share systems allow people to borrow a bike from a "dock" which is usually computer-controlled wherein the user enters the payment information, and the system unlocks it. This bike can then be returned to another dock belonging to the same system.
-  A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. The company is finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario. In this context,
-  BoomBikes want to understand the factors affecting the demand for these shared bikes in the American market.
-  The company wants to know:
1. Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
2. How well those variables describe the bike demands
- Dataset for the bike can be found in day.csv present in the repo.

## Conclusions
- 18 of the independent attributes are sufficient to determine accuracy.  Following are the attributes: holiday, windspeed, registered
mnth_dec, mnth_feb, mnth_jan, mnth_jul, mnth_mar, mnth_may, mnth_nov, mnth_oct, mnth_sept, weekday_mon, weekday_sat, weekday_sun, weekday_wed,
weathersit_bad, weathersit_good.

- VIF for the independent attributes are not infinity thus indicating no correlation between attributes.
- Scatter plot of errors are evenly distributed.
- Error Terms lie around mean.
